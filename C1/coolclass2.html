    <h1 class="cold">Not feeling cool?</h1>
    <p>If you're not feeling cool or confident, it's important to remember that feelings of self-doubt and insecurity
        are common experiences that many people go through at different points in their lives.
        It's also important to recognize that "coolness" is a subjective and often superficial concept that doesn't
        define your worth as a person.</p>
    <p>Here are some steps to consider if you're not feeling cool:</p>
    <h2>Engage in Activities You Enjoy: </h2>
    <p>Participate in activities that make you feel good and bring you joy.
        Doing things you're passionate about can boost your mood and self-esteem.</p>
    <h2>Practice Self-Care:</h2>
    <p> Taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being is essential.
        Get enough sleep, eat nutritiously, exercise, and engage in relaxation techniques. </p>
    <h2>Self-Reflection:</h2>
    <p> Take some time to reflect on what might be causing you to feel this way.
        Is it due to comparing yourself to others, unrealistic expectations, or personal challenges? Identifying the
        root causes can help you address them more effectively.</p>
